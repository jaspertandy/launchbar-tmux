# Search through your tmux and tmuxinator sessions with LaunchBar 6

Clone this repo to "tmux.lbaction" then double-click to install

At some pont, you'll need to change [session.rb](https://github.com/jaspertandy/launchbar-tmux/blob/master/Contents/Scripts/session.rb#L9) to `sudo -u YOURUSERNAME` because I don't know how to glean this from context, and there's currently no LaunchBar documentation

This should currently be used out of nothing but sheer morbid curiosity. I will be continuously updating this as documentation becomes available, but it should never be considered fit for use.
